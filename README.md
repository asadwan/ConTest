# ConTest

### ConTest (CONtext TESTing) is a model-based testing tool that enables and simplifies the effective testing of context-aware applications.

The core components of ConTest are two domain-specific languages (DSL):
- [**Context Definition Language**](https://github.com/asadwan/cdl): A DSL for producing context models for context-aware applications.
- [**Context-driven Behavioral Modeling Language**](https://github.com/asadwan/cbml): A DSL based on Finite State Machine (FSM) for producing bahavioral (fucntional) models for context-aware applications.
